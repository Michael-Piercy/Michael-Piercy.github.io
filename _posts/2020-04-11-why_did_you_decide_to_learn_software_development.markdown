A few years ago, I received a Bachelor's degree in Applied Behavioral Science from Ashford University with the intention of entering the behavioral health/counseling profession. Unfortunately, obtaining meaningful employment in this field proved to be challenging since I did not have actual work experience. Shortly thereafter, I began researching the world of tech and began exploring various types of professions within this field. While narrowing down choices, I came across some free coding resources online and began learning to code using FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project. As I delved deeper into coding using these resources, I discovered I was able to tap into my troubleshooting and debugging side through coding, which was exciting and exhilarating to me. While I did learn quite a bit using those free coding resources, I found that teaching myself to code is a rather daunting task. I felt I took my self learning as far as I could, hence the reason why I chose to further my coding education through Flatiron School.

Truthfully, the decision to learn Software Engineering initially centered around the career outlook of this field, and higher wages that can be attained. However, as I progressed through some online coding lessons and modules, I realized my interest in this profession was much deeper than that. Sure money and job security is extremely important, but truly having a passion for what you do is something that is almost priceless. It is quite rare for an individual to not only make a good living, but also be extremely passionate about what he or she does for a living. As I have learned coding, I have felt my level of passion for it increase significantly. I am excited for this opportunity to learn Software Engineering through Flatiron School, and I am looking forward to collaborating extensively with my instructors and peers.
